## Problem 2

First time experience with a Iaas service, Digital Ocean. Creating a web based Ubuntu 16.04 server so easily was fun. Learnt a bit about IaaS/SaaS/PaaS and using these for development and deployment.

Learnt about VPN and more specifically about the suggested [`streisand`](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) working and deployment, the various services, features and platforms supported.
Succesfully deployed a `streisand` server on Ubuntu 16.04 server hosted on a Digital Ocean Droplet. 
Succesfully tested it with a an android device as well as my Windows 10 PC.
