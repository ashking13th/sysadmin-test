## Problem 2

First time experience with a Iaas service, Digital Ocean. Creating a web based Ubuntu 16.04 server so easily was fun. Learnt a bit about IaaS/SaaS/PaaS and using these for development and deployment.

Learnt about VPN and more specifically about the suggested [`streisand`](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) working and deployment, the various services, features and platforms supported.
Succesfully deployed a `streisand` server on Ubuntu 16.04 server hosted on a Digital Ocean Droplet. 
Succesfully tested it with an android device as well as my Windows 10 PC.

The `streisand` provides us with a very simplified and automated way of setting up a lot of services and access methods upon the OpenVPN server viz SSL, Tor etc. This helps us to set up all these services in just 15-20 minutes (Including creating the ubuntu server) which might otherwise take days to set up indivisually one-by-one.

Screenshots from my phone and PC while setting up and connecting with the ``streisand`` server are in [images](/images) folder.
