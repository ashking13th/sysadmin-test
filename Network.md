## Problem 1

## Problem 2

`students.iitmandi.ac.in` is a subdomain of `iitmandi.ac.in` . Subdomains do not require a separate registration, they are a part of the main domain itself. So we can say the registration details of students.iitmandi.ac.in will be same as that of iitmandi.ac.in .

A simple whois lookup gives us the required data.

Sponsoring Registrar: `ERNET India (R9-AFIN)`



## Problem 3

DuckDuckGo uses AWS EC2 servers as well as it's own data servers.

DuckDuckgo does not own data centres.

The Git repository, crawling, and the real-time Wikipedia index might still reside in Gabriel Weinberg's basement ( Valley Forge, PA (USA) ), rest of everything is in 4 AWS data centers (California, Virginia, Singapore, Ireland).
